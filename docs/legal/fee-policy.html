      <h1>Fee Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Annex 1 - Fee Policy of Gamma Earth</strong></p>
      <p>This fee policy (the “Fee Policy”) supplements the License Agreement with regards to the financial terms and conditions applicable to the License Fees for the use of the Software and the Services. Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this Fee Policy or, where not defined herein, the meaning set forth in the License Agreement.</p>

      <h2>License Fees</h2>
      <p>The License Fees for access and use of the Software and/or the Services are calculated on data-consumption on a one-time basis, as set out in the following schedule:</p>
      <p><em>[Insert schedule or tables if needed]</em></p>
      <p>Gamma Earth may introduce, at any time and at its sole discretion, additional types of data subscription packages in the future, such as monthly and or annual subscription plans. Such offering, if and when made available, will be published in an updated version of this Fee Policy and on the Store.</p>
      <p>Licensee must select a Data Allowance within the Min Order - Max Order range. Payments must occur once, monthly or annually prior to accessing the Software and/or the Services, unless specified otherwise in the Store and/or the Order Documents. Upon receipt of payment, the purchased Data Allowance will be activated, and the corresponding data volume will be made available for use.</p>
      <p>Gamma Earth makes no representation or warranty that the License Fees are the lowest or best price at any given time during the term of the subscription.</p>

      <h2>Data Allowance</h2>
      <p>For Data Allowances with one-time quotas, any unused quota will expire within twenty four (24) months from the date of purchase.</p>
      <p>When and if made available, for Data Allowances with monthly quotas, the quota is renewed at the start of every calendar month (provided timely payment). Any unused quota does not carry over to the next month and will expire if not used within the month for which it was allocated.</p>
      <p>When and if made available, for Data Allowances with annual quotas, unused quota do not carry over to the next renewal period and will expire if not used within the annual term for which it was allocated.</p>
      <p>Licensee may add additional Data Allowances as top-up Data Allowances.</p>
      <p>Gamma Earth reserves the right to offer plans that continue beyond the data quota included in the selected Data Allowance. In such cases, Gamma Earth will charge Licensee overage fees based on the excess usage, at the end of the applicable billing period. Licensee agrees to pay all such overage fees.</p>

      <h2>Prices</h2>
      <p>All prices are indicated in Swiss Francs, unless stated otherwise in the Store or in the Order Documents. Prices may differ based on geographical regions of usage of the Data Allowances.</p>
      <p>Prices are exclusive of taxes. Licensee shall be responsible for all sales, use, excise and value added taxes and any other similar taxes, duties and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state or local governmental body on any amounts payable by Licensee hereunder and shall pay all License Fees payable under the License Agreement free and clear of all deductions and withholdings whatsoever, unless the deduction or withholding is required by law. If any deduction or withholding is required by law, Licensee shall pay to Gamma Earth such sum as will, after the deduction or withholding has been made, leave Gamma Earth with the same amount as it would have been entitled to receive without any such requirement to make a deduction or withholding.</p>
      <p>Gamma Earth reserves the right to modify the prices at any time and at its sole discretion. Any price modification will be notified to Licensee in advance by email and/or will be published on the Store and will apply at the start of Licensee’s next billing cycle, unless specified otherwise.</p>

      <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
      <h3>Payment Methods</h3>
      <p>Gamma Earth accepts the payment methods indicated in the Store and/or the Order Documents. Gamma Earth reserves the right to change the accepted payment methods, at its sole discretion, and may refuse individual payment methods without giving any reasons.</p>
      <p>Licensee agrees and authorizes Gamma Earth to store the payment method(s) selected by Licensee directly or through a third-party service provider.</p>

      <h3>Recurring Billing</h3>
      <p>When and if monthly and/or annual subscription plans are made available in the future, Licensee agrees and authorizes Gamma Earth to automatically charge the payment method(s) selected by Licensee each month or year, depending on Licensee’s plan, until termination of the License Agreement.</p>
      <p>Gamma Earth will automatically charge the then-current rate for the subscription, plus applicable taxes (such as VAT, if the rate does not include it), every month or year upon renewal, until termination of the License Agreement.</p>
      <p>Licensee warrants that he/she/it shall remain the owner of the payment method specified for License Fees and that such payment method has a sufficient limit (credit card) or sufficient funds (bank accounts) to pay any due License Fees.</p>
      <p>Licensee will receive notice prior to any automatic renewal of the plan in accordance with applicable law.</p>

      <h3>Late Payment</h3>
      <p>If payments are not received by Gamma Earth within thirty (30) days after becoming due, Gamma Earth may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>suspend the provision of all or part of the Services;</li>
        <li>immediately terminate this Agreement without notice or compensation;</li>
        <li>charge an interest rate of 5% per annum on the total amount of any late payment;</li>
        <li>charge a reminder fee of CHF 50.- for each payment reminder issued;</li>
        <li>take any additional measures deemed necessary to prevent further damage, such as engaging a debt collection agency, with the associated costs to be borne by Licensee.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>No Offset</h3>
      <p>Licensee is not authorized to set off its claims against those of Gamma Earth.</p>

      <h3>Refunds</h3>
      <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, License Fees paid are non-refundable. This does not affect any statutory refund rights the Licensee may have as a consumer, particularly in the event of a valid withdrawal under applicable consumer protection laws.</p>

      <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
      <h3>Amendments</h3>
      <p>Gamma Earth may amend this Fee Policy at its sole discretion and at any time.</p>
      <p>The promulgation of the new versions of the Fee Policy is announced via the Platform. New versions of the Fee Policy shall take effect for new Licensees immediately and for existing Licensees at the start of their next billing cycle, unless specified otherwise. After the new versions become effective, continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the amended Fee Policy.</p>

      <h3>No Waiver</h3>
      <p>Any failure by Gamma Earth to enforce any right or provision of this Fee Policy will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>

      <h3>Severability</h3>
      <p>If any provisions of this Fee Policy, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement.</p>

      <h3>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
      <p>This Fee Policy shall in all respects be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of Switzerland, irrespective of any conflict of law rules.</p>
      <p>Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Fee Policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the city of Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>

      <p>Any question about this Fee Policy shall be addressed to <a href="mailto:info@gamma.earth">info@gamma.earth</a>.</p>
