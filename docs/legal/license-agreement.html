Neither Party shall have the authority to bind the other in any manner whatsoever or in favour of anyone whomsoever, except in accordance with this Agreement.</p>

      <h3>14.2. Gamma Earth’s Policies</h3>

      </ol>

      <h3>14.3. Force Majeure</h3>
      <p>Neither Party shall bear any liability or deemed to be in breach of this Agreement for any delays or failures in performance of this Agreement that result from circumstances beyond the reasonable control of that Party. The Party affected by such circumstances shall promptly notify the other Party in writing when such circumstances cause a delay or failure in performance and when they cease to do so. A Party claiming such an event must use its best endeavours to remove, overcome, or minimise the effects of that event as quickly as possible. This does not require the Party to settle any industrial dispute in any way that it considers inappropriate.</p>

      <h3>14.4. References and Publicity</h3>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Neither Party shall issue or release any announcement, statement, press release or other publicity or marketing materials relating to this Agreement without the prior consent of the other Party. Any communication to the press or any other third party will be reviewed and agreed by both Parties before such communication is made, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</li>

The foregoing is subject to any support and maintenance agreement between the Parties which expressly refers to this Agreement.</p>

      <h3>14.7. Severability</h3>
      <p>If any provisions of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement. If a contractual provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify said provision and replace it by a valid provision that comes as close as possible to the original intent of the Parties and the economic purpose of the invalid provision. The same procedure must be followed if a contractual loophole appears.</p>

      </ol>
